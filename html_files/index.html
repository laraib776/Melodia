<h1 > JAZZ :</h1>
<p> Jazz is a music genre that originated 
    in the African-American communities of
    New Orleans,Louisiana, United States, in the late 19th and early
    20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtimeSince the
    1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical
    expression in traditional and popular music, linked by the common
    bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage.
    Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response
    vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in European
    Harmony and African rhythmic rituals.</p>
<h2>RISE OF JAZZ MUSIC :</h2>
 <p>As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging "musician's music" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.</p>
<h2>MODERN JAZZ DEVELOPMENT :</h2>
 <p>The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz. </p>
<h2>ORIGIN :</h2>
<p > The origin of the word jazz has resulted 
    in considerable research,
    and its history is well documented. It is believed
    to be related to jasm, a slang term dating back to 1860 meaning
    "pep, energy"</p>

<h2> FEMALE COMPOSERS :</h2>
<p>Female jazz performers and composers have contributed to jazz throughout its history. Although Betty Carter, Ella Fitzgerald, Adelaide Hall, Billie Holiday, Abbey Lincoln, Anita O'Day, Dinah Washington, and Ethel Waters were recognized for their vocal talent, less familiar were bandleaders, composers, and instrumentalists such as pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong, trumpeter Valaida Snow, and songwriters Irene Higginbotham and Dorothy Fields. Women began playing instruments in jazz in the early 1920s, drawing particular recognition on piano. </p>

<h2>AFR_AMERICAN JAZZ COMPOSERS :</h2>
<p>For some African Americans, jazz has drawn attention to African-American contributions to culture and history. For others, jazz is a reminder of "an oppressive and racist society and restrictions on their artistic visions".Amiri Baraka argues that there is a "white jazz" genre that expresses whiteness.White jazz musicians appeared in the midwest and in other areas throughout the U.S. Papa Jack Laine, who ran the Reliance band in New Orleans in the 1910s, was called "the father of white jazz". The Original Dixieland Jazz Band, whose members were white, were the first jazz group to record, and Bix Beiderbecke was one of the most prominent jazz soloists of the 1920s. The Chicago Style was developed by white musicians such as Eddie Condon, Bud Freeman, Jimmy McPartland, and Dave Tough. Others from Chicago such as Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa became leading members of swing during the 1930s. Many bands included both black and white musicians. These musicians helped change attitudes toward race in the U.S</p>
